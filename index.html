			<h2 id="intro" style="margin-top: 0;">Music has Evolved</h2>

			<p>

				<strong>I believe we can agree as a society that music has changed immensely over the past 100 years.</strong>
				With major innovations in artistic expression and technology, new musical mediums, instruments, consumption methods, and genres have appeared.
				So what were the largests catalysts in musical culture and expression in the last 100 years?

			<h2 id="mediums">Musical Mediums and Access</h2>

			<p>

				The world has changed drastically since the time of the phonographic cylinder. Today, you likely use Spotify or Apple Music to stream your favorite songs.
				<strong>The internet has likely been the most important change in musical medium and access to ever occur.</strong>
				Before the information age, music was expensive, less diverse, and harder to access.
				Successful small, independent artists and indie bands were extremely rare as they couldn't compete and usually died out due to needing large brand deals in order to cover the costs
				of manufacturing physical items for release. Now, with services like Bandcamp, small artists and labels can
				pay nominal fees to publish their music online. The influence of the internet on music is <a href="#the_internet">further discussed here</a>.
				Below is a small timeline of musical mediums. Which one do you know best?

			<h2 id="the_internet" style="margin-top: 0;">The Internet</h2>

			<p>

				<strong>The internet has changed the way music is approached for both artists and fans.</strong> For artists, gone are the times of <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/4a/35/ab4a35191ae571b18db802da96946dd9.jpg">physical racks</a>
				and other expensive hardware and software. Nowadays, musical artists can create music with software that ranges from free to ~$1000 in price. This decrease in production cost has changed music forever.
				You can get a copy of <a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/">Ableton Live</a>, or <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV Rack</a> and produce professionally mixed
				tracks in days or even hours, even if you've never made music before. This is largely in part due to the large communities that back the software and its simplicity. It's crazy how you can make music with a $300 computer, a free
				Digital Audio Workstation, and some free presets available on the internet.

			</p>

			<p>

				For fans, listening to music has become an immensely simple task. Before the Internet was popular, you'd have to go to a record shop to buy vinyls, tapes, or CDs for every new release.
				Now, you can buy music albums online or even stream millions of artists and albums for miniscule prices.

			</p>

			<p>

				Artists once needed to be backed by music publishing and distribution companies in order to reach fans' ears and turn a profit. Not only did this
				prevent artists from exhibiting unique and experimental creative choices, it also made it difficult for small artists to live off of
				music as publishing and distribution companies would take major cuts out of their profits. Now, small artists that you've likely never heard of
				can live their lives in mansions in Los Angeles off of experimental vaporpop music (see <a href="https://twitter.com/MirrorKissesVA">George Clanton</a>).
